### More info

**Refont** allows you to set Discord's font to any font installed on your computer. Additionally, it can do so automatically on startup, if wanted.

It is designed to be easy to use and minimal, with a sleek UI to help fulfill it's only purpose: change Discord's font.


### How it works

Refont works by launching Discord (closing first if needed) with an open port for debugging, which it can then use to send commands to change the font. Opening Discord with this debugging port must be done with a special command, which Refont will do for you whenever you open it.

As should be expected, **I am not responsible if your account gets banned and this software comes with no sort of warranty.** There shouldn't be any reason for a ban, as all this does is Discord's font, though of course anything can happen.
